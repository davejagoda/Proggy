For a branch where everything is OK, you'll see something like this:

/Users/dj/Source/Github/Proggy
* master
  remotes/origin/master
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean

If you see this (which is typically he result of a git clone):

  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master

You can clean up by doing this:

git remote set-head origin -d
