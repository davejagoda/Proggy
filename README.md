Instead of having a bunch of somewhat useful proggy directories
scattered all over the place, I am putting them all in one place.  In
addition, these I feel at least are good enough to show to someone
else . . .

python
------

stop using `python2`, only use `python3`

stop using `requirements.txt` and `virtualenv` (directly), only use
`Pipfile` and `pipenv`
